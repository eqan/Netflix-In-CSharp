### A Localized Netflix Clone Made In C#

Utilizing the best of Algorithms, I have created this project on an experimental basis to discover the mechanism/possibilities of Technologies which somewhat covers the fundamentals of the Online Video streaming servies such as Youtube & Netflix.

#### _Note: This Project Is Solely Made For Educational Purposes & Is Entirely Self Made, None Of This Has RelationShip Of Any Kind With Netflix Or Any Other Video Streaming Service_.
